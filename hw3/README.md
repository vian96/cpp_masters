`nth_power.cpp` contains what I thought would be a good overload set of nth_power. However, default argument in general overload is not such a good idea but i thought removing it is easier than writing, so i left it to show how i'd handle it if it's needed. 

To run it, either use default CMake's default running commands, or just run `./run_tests.sh`
